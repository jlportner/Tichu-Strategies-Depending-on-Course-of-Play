 [m
     In addition to luck and strategy, this game became popular within our friend-group due to its fairly unique aspect of interaction. Allowing for multiple possible card combinations, special cards and a process of card switching, Tichu derives its complexity not through complicated rules, but rather through diverseness of strategy. Indeed, given one must adapt to one‚Äôs opponents‚Äô and teammate‚Äôs strategies, one may say its strategies are interactive and reactive in nature. Therefore ‚Äì although we note that card games are hard to analyse in general ‚Äì we believe Tichu is indeed approachable through game-theoretic methods. [m
 [m
     Fascinated by this type of game and equipped with tools from our game theory course, we pose the general question: ‚Äúwhich strategy should we pursue as players?‚Äù. We shall further differentiate this admittedly vague question into: ‚Äúwhat strategy should we pursue given‚Äù: a) ‚Äúwe know what player-type all other players are‚Äù and b) ‚Äúwe do not know anything about other players‚Äù. [m
 \section{Introduction on Tichu}[m
 [m
[31m-Tichu is a card game with four players, where two players form a team. the goal is to reach 1000 points as a team. One round consists of several games where the two teams try to get points.[m
[31m-At the beginning of a game, every player gets 14 cards. He exchanges one card with every other player. This will be called the "Exchange Stage", which we will discuss later on. After the exchange of the cards, the regular game takes place. There are two major ways ti achieve points: 1st Claiming Cards with a value, 2nd Announcing a Tichu. The Game ends, when one team finished of their cards. Then you count the values of the cards and this value to your score.[m

The Game ends, when one team finished of their cards. If one team finished of their cards before one of the opposing team finished, then the winner team receives the cards from both opponent players. If the team finished of their cards and someone from the opposing team finished before, only the last player passes away the cards to the winner team. Then you count the values of the cards and this value to your score.[m
 [m
 A Tichu-set consists of the cards 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A in four different colors: red, blue, green and black. There are four special cards Dragon, Phoenix, Dogs and Mah Jong. In total we have 56 cards, every player receives 14 cards. However, only a few cards have a value as listed in the table:\\[m

 A game starts, when a player plays a valid combination. The other players can now try to play a higher version of the same combination (as many cards as the combination). If no player can or wants to play a higher combination, the player with the highest combination takes the cards and can play a new combination. There are several valid combinations:[m

 The willingness to take risks is characterized by the fact that even with below average cards (relative to cards with which the average player would announce a tichu) he already announces the tichu. [m
 [m
 The second player is the "defensive player". This stands in contrast to the "aggressive player type". He is rather risk-averse, which means he needs above average (relative to cards with which the average player would announce a tichu) good cards to announce a tichu.[m
