# TichuPaper

In the course "an introduction to game theory", we analyzed the game Tichu under game theoretical aspects. Thereby we analyzed the shovelling and the game itself. In this repository you will find both the paper itself and any code used for information retrieval, evaluation or simulation. In addition, all graphics are provided in an extra folder. Have fun!
